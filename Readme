This program is built to assist you in configuring your Nexus Prime Miner.
Please feel free to modify it for your builds.

Steps
1) Rename the miner.config from your Nexus_cpuminer folder to miner.config.backup
2) Place Nexus_Configurator.bat in the Nexus_cpuminer folder
3) Run Nexus_Configurator.bat
4) Your miner is now configured, if errors arise revert back to the miner.config.backup file by removing the ".backup"

Finally,
Please add your stats to the cryptosoldier.com nexus benchmark site so I can improve upon this program.
